# Streamlit Secrets Configuration
# ==================================
# This file shows the structure for configuring API keys
# DO NOT commit the actual secrets.toml file with real keys to git

# RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION: User-Provided API Keys
# --------------------------------------------------
# For multi-user apps, do NOT set a shared API key here.
# Instead, users will enter their own API keys via the sidebar modal.
# Their keys will be saved in browser localStorage.

# To use this approach:
# 1. Leave the OPENAI_API_KEY line commented out (as shown below)
# 2. Users click "🔑 API Config" in the sidebar
# 3. Enter their personal OpenAI API key
# 4. Key is saved in browser and persists across sessions

# OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your-api-key-here"


# ALTERNATIVE: Shared API Key (Not Recommended for Production)
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# Only use this for:
# - Single-user local development
# - Trusted team environments
# - Demo/testing purposes

# To enable shared API key:
# 1. Uncomment the line above
# 2. Replace "sk-your-api-key-here" with your actual API key
# 3. Restart the app
# ⚠️ WARNING: Usage costs will be shared across all users!


# Deployment on Streamlit Cloud:
# -------------------------------
# 1. Go to your Streamlit Cloud app dashboard
# 2. Click on "Settings" > "Secrets"
# 3. Add: OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-key-here"
# 4. Save - the app will restart automatically


# Optional: Other API keys for future features
# GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = ""
# POSTCODE_API_KEY = ""
