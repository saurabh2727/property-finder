        st.markdown("""
        **Problem**: "My CSV file won't upload properly"
        **Solution**: Ensure your CSV file has proper headers and is saved in UTF-8 encoding. Check that suburb names match standard formats.

        **Problem**: "Some suburbs are missing from my analysis"
        **Solution**: Check for spelling variations in suburb names. The system will attempt to match similar names but may need manual correction.

        **Problem**: "HtAG data integration is not working"
        **Solution**: Verify you have the correct HtAG file format. Contact support if you need help with specific data source integration.

        **Problem**: "I lost my progress when switching tabs"
        **Solution**: The platform now automatically saves progress. If you experience issues, check the session status in the workflow progress bar.

        **Problem**: "My recommendations disappeared"
        **Solution**: Use the session recovery system - the platform automatically backs up your data. Check the 'Detailed Investment Insights' tab to verify recommendations are available.

        **Problem**: "Agent Review shows 'No recommendations available'"
        **Solution**: Ensure you've completed the AI recommendation step first. The system now includes session recovery to restore missing data.

        **Problem**: "PDF generation is not working"
        **Solution**: The PDF generation system has been fully implemented. Ensure your analysis is complete and try the 'Generate PDF Report' button in the Reports tab.

    with st.expander("Analysis & Scoring Questions"):
        st.markdown("""
        **Question**: "Why are the suburb scores different from my expectations?"
        **Answer**: Scoring is based on objective data analysis. Your local knowledge is valuable - use the Agent Review step to adjust scores and add professional insights.

        **Question**: "Can I change the scoring weights for different criteria?"
        **Answer**: Yes, you can adjust weights for growth potential, rental yield, risk factors, and client fit in the analysis settings.

        **Question**: "How current is the market data used in analysis?"
        **Answer**: Data currency depends on your source. HtAG data is typically updated quarterly, while other sources may vary. Always check data dates before presenting to clients.

        **Question**: "How do I change the number of recommended suburbs?"
        **Answer**: Use the prominent slider in the 'AI Recommendations' and 'Detailed Investment Insights' tabs to select between 5-20 suburbs. This helps tailor the analysis to your client's decision-making capacity.

        **Question**: "Which recommendation engine was used for my analysis?"
        **Answer**: Check the engine type displayed in the recommendations. AI/GenAI is primary, with Rule-Based as fallback. Export filenames also indicate the engine used (e.g., 'ai_genai_recommendations.csv').
